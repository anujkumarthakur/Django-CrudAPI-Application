	I have Wrote This application in free time for tutorial and practics purpose.
	It's a open Repo if you want to contribute with this project you can continue do change and make better application.
	
	we are going to build a simple but beautiful CRUD application using the Python Web Development Framework called Django
	
	We can create a RESTFUL API (Application Program Interface) which will serve as a relay between our application 
	frontend and the database. From the Android or the IOS, we can then interact with this API which will in turn 
	communicate with the database to retrieve for us the data we need or perform the desired CRUD actions for us. 
	Without much ado, letâ€™s get started!!!


	i'll teach you step-wise-step how to run this application 
	
	Linux/Ubuntu---:
		
		git clone git@github.com:anujkumarthakur/Django-CrudAPI-Application.git
		python3 manage.py runserver
